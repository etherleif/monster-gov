## About this Repository

This repository will be used for

- documentation of our vision for governance at Polychain Monsters
- development of the governance related smart contracts used at Polychain Monsters

## Governance Process

The Governance Process for Polchain Monsters DAO involves two steps:

- creating an on-chain proposal
- and voting on it

To prevent spam and ensure that the proposed changes serve the Polychain Monstes DAO, proposals require a certain amount of locked $PMON, currently set at 100,000+.

Users can discuss ideas in a dedicated Discord channel and find a sponsor if they lack the required $PMON. Delegating votes is being considered.

Voting power calculation is under development, likely based on the number of owned monsters. Not necessarily the number of owned Gen-1 Monsters.

A similar setup can be found at https://nouns.center/funding/proposals.

> **Disclaimer**: This is work in progress. Concepts & Processes might and probably will change, also after transition of Polychain Monsters to a DAO. Also DAOs have to adapt if the environment changes or we recognize flaws in the DAO design.
