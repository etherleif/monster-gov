## About this Repository

This repository will be used for

- documentation of our vision for governance at Polychain Monsters
- development of the governance related smart contracts used at Polychain Monsters

## Governance Process

The Governance Process for Polchain Monsters DAO involves the following steps:

- creating an on-chain proposal
- and voting on it
- queueing the actions (e.g. the tx to send $PMON from treasury to the receiver of a grant)
- executing the actions on-chain

To prevent spam and ensure that the proposed changes serve the Polychain Monstes DAO, proposals require a certain amount of locked $PMON, currently set at 100,000+.

Users can discuss ideas in a dedicated Discord channel and find a sponsor if they lack the required $PMON. Delegating votes is being considered.

Voting power calculation is under development, likely based on the number of owned monsters. Not necessarily the number of owned Gen-1 Monsters.

A similar setup can be found at https://nouns.center/funding/proposals.
